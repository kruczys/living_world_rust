# Living world with evolution

This project is a simple world simulation, in the future it might contain graphics. In this simulated world organism live and coexist, the world is turn based. Whole project is derived from one of my university's final assignments. My goal is to implement a simulation of evolution, and learn Rust language.

## Todo

Not in any particular order

- [ ] Add organisms
- [ ] Add organisms interaction logic, collisions etc.
- [ ] Add evolution
- [ ] Add world printing mechanic, before graphics
- [ ] Add world turns
- [ ] Add graphics
- [ ] Finish readme
- [ ] Add statistics, with detailed info on evolution e.g. which trait evolved at which turn, which trait was the strongest in current world
- [ ] Add organism behavior e.g. wolfs attack in packs
- [ ] Add world traits like temperature or bodies of water, which influence organisms e.g. if it's too cold plants die
- [ ] Add more traits for organisms
- [ ] Add family tree for each organism
- [ ] Add random name for each organism
- [ ] Add interactivity e.g. user can place organisms with mouse
- [ ] Compile to wasm and create web application
- [ ] Add "god" abilities for user e.g. ability to kill any organism through interface
